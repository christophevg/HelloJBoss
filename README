This project tries to evolve from a simple JBoss HelloWorld Servlet into an
implementation using as many commonly used Java technologies as possible.

I  started documenting my explorations into these technologies using this 
source  tree, when I needed to take up a new project and had to refresh my 
knowledge. This time I wanted to go over all aspects in detail, before relying 
on predefined build systems that take care of most of all this for me.

The goal is to use: JBoss, a Servlet, an EJB Bean, all nicely packaged in 
JAR's, WAR's & EAR's, with database access to a MySQL server, JSF, Seam 2, 
Maven, ...

All steps are documented on http://christophe.vg/HelloJBoss.
A Git repository containing all intermediate steps as separate commits is 
available from git://github.com/christophevg/HelloJBoss.git 
with a web-front-end at http://github.com/christophevg/HelloJBoss
